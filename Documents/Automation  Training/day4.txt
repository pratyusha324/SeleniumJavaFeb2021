earlier OS
   the only way to talk to computer was thru terminal.

   you have to issue a command

   <<command name>> <<options>  <<arguments>>

    ls -- list the files in the directory
       options will change the output little bit 



   cd -- change directory 

   path -- two types  -- absolute and relative 

   shortcuts 
       .   --- current folder
       .. -- parent folder
